# Treehouse-Learn_React
Online course, [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), following the [Learn React track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/learn-react). The track contains the topics: React Basics, React Components, Create React App, Context API, React Router, React v16 and Data Fetching in React.
The README.md contains an overview of the courses in the track, as well as some of my own notes and takeaways from each part.

## React Basics
### *About this course:*
>React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes building and maintaining the user interface of your application faster and easier by breaking it up into smaller, reusable components. It also helps eliminate the complexity that comes with updating your DOM elements when the user interacts with your application.
### *What you will learn:*
- JSX
- Props
- State
- Components
- Events
#### First Steps in React
#### Thinking in Components
#### Introducing Props
#### Understanding State

## React Components
### *About this course:*
>Components are the core building blocks of a React application. This course will level-up your React skills by providing a better understanding of class vs. functional components, state and lifecycle methods, and how to split your UI into reusable and composable components.
#### Build Modular Interfaces with Components
#### Managing State and Data Flow
#### Stateful Components and Lifecycle Methods
#### React Component Patterns

## Using Create React App
### *About this workshop:*
>Learn to quickly set up React projects using Create React App.
#### What is Create React App?
#### Installing and Using Create React App
#### Customizing Your Project
#### Next steps with Create React App

## React Context API
### *About this workshop*
>In the typical React data flow, components communicate with each other via props. A parent passes props down to child components. Sometimes the intermediary components get props passed to them with the sole purpose of passing that data down one (or several) more levels deep. This cascade of props is often referred to as "prop drilling". The React Context API provides a way to pass data to components without having to pass props manually at every single level.
#### What is the Context API?
#### How the Context Works
#### Create Context
#### Provide and Consume State
#### The Provider and Consumer Solution
#### Provide and Consume Actions
#### Provide Remaining Actions to Child Components
#### Refactor the Provider
#### Refactor the Consumers

## React Router 4 Basics
### *About this course:*
>Learn to use React Router v4, a declarative routing solution for React, to manage navigation and rendering of components in your applications.
### *What you will learn:*
- Declaring routes
- Navigating between routes
- Nesting routes
- URL parameters
- 404 error routes
- Changing routes programmatically
#### Getting Started with React Router
#### Navigating, Nesting and Redirecting Routes
#### Going Further with Routing

## What's new in React 16
### *About this workshop*
>Get up to speed with new features in React 16, a complete rewrite of the React library.
#### Introducing React 16
#### Take Control of Errors with componentDidCatch()
#### Catching Errors with Error Boundaries
#### New Return Types
#### Render Children into other Dom Nodes with Portals
#### Returning null from setState

## Data Fetching in React
### *About this workshop*
>Learn different methods for fetching external data in React, and how to display the data in your app.
#### Fetching Data with the Fetch API
#### Fetching Data with Axios
#### Displaying the Data
